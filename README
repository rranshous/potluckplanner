implimentation

it would be convenient if the site could be made more
simple by having each use have their own "site"

i'm looking at using aws lambda targeting serverless for the frontend
redis style backend namespaced, somehow embed the unique name
for the site in all it's interacts w/ the server.
cname seems like it might be an answer
could do anything in the URL really, especially if i'm targeting single page

security through obscurity =] craigslist style
